# The primitives
**The primitives:** 
string , number , and boolean
JavaScript has three very commonly used primitives: string, number, and boolean. Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript. 
As you might expect, these are the same names you’d see if you used the JavaScript typeof operator on a value of those types:
- string represents string values like "Hello, world"
- number is for numbers like 42. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there’s no equivalent to int or float everything is simply number
- boolean is for the two values true and false
>note ✨:The type names String, Number, and Boolean (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. Always use string, number, or boolean for types.
