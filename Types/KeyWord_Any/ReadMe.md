## What is Any Key Word ðŸ“Œ
TypeScript also has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you donâ€™t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
When a value is of type any, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function,
assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else thatâ€™s syntactically legal:
## what is not Implicit Any ðŸ“Œ
When you donâ€™t specify a type, and TypeScript canâ€™t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to any.
You usually want to avoid this, though, because any isnâ€™t type-checked. Use the compiler flag noImplicitAny to flag any implicit any as an error.
